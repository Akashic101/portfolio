# Portfolio

This is the repo of my personal portfolio powered by 11ty. You can access it under https://davidmoll.net

## How It Works

1. The website is written in Nunjuck
2. 11ty converts all files into HTML upon launch of the project into a folder called `_site`
3. The website is managed by nginx and accessible via Cloudflare Tunnels
