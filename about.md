<h1>Hi, I am David ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<section class="about-section">
    <p>
      I am 27 years old, living in Germany with my two cats and am currently job-hunting ;) 
      (<a href="/contact">Let's connect</a> if you are in need of an experienced web-developer). 
      I have worked across a wide variety of projects from developing a CRUD-system to manage employees and contracts to expanding, developing and maintaining the custom UI-library of an energy supply company in Germany. 
      You can check out the full list of all my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>Outside of work I enjoy motorsport, photography, running and cycling, media-design and working on my selfhosted homelab. If you want to see more of my daily life, why not check out my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidmoll.net">BlueSky</a>? There I semi-actively post about things that interest me, post my newest pictures I shot and share whats interesting in my world.
